speediff
========

speediff is a C# WinForms app that enables you to quickly compare past Git or SVN revisions for a file. It shows you a diff of two consecutive revisions, and allows you to move forward or back to other pairs of revisions. It preloads all of the revisions, to minimize annoyance when dealing with a slow SVN server.

It is inspired by [SVN Time Lapse View][1], a useful but long-abandoned Java application (which was in turn inspired by Perforce's time-lapse view).
